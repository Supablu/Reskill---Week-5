            <h4>Patience and Fortitude for All New Yorkers</h4>
            <p>
              Since its founding in 1995, The Community Library has unwaveringly
              served New York City, no matter the circumstances. The COVID-19
              pandemic brought forth unprecedented challenges for our city and
              our patrons. But as it has always done, the Library quickly
              adapted to ensure communities could still access the information
              and resources they needed. While constantly monitoring the rapidly
              changing circumstances, the Library increased its core digital
              services—from e-book access to online learning support for
              students, remote research services, online programs, and virtual
              one-on-one job support. And as soon as it could, the Library
              reopened all available branch locations across the Bronx,
              Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island in phases to ensure
              that New Yorkers could access the services and resources they rely
              on. The Library was founded on the ideals of free and open access
              to knowledge and opportunity for everyone. The challenges of 2020
              and 2021 did not deter, but rather reaffirmed NYPL’s central
              objective to serve New Yorkers through even the most turbulent
              times—a testament to the enduring legacy of the Library as one of
              the city’s most essential civic institutions.
